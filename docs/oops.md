## What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm which is based on objects. The object consists of data and the methods that operate on the data. Some of the properties of object oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. Example of Object Oriented Programming: Java, C++, Ruby

## What are some other methods of Programming Paradigms?

    1. Imperative Programming
    2. Procedural Programming
    3. Functional Programming
    4. Declarative Programming
    5. Logic Programming
    6. Symbolic Programming

## What are the advantages of Object Oriented Programming?
Programs are **modular** i.e. data & methods associated with data are put together which reduces the complexity ane streamlines the data access. Also, it is **extensible & reusable** i.e. you can extend the functionality of the classes through inheritance.

## What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is a process in which data and methods that operate on the data are bundled together into class and provides restricted access to the data. This process is called encapsulation. 

## What is Abstraction?
As a result of encapsulation, we provide an abstract view of the object. i.e. we hide the complexities of the object within the private methods. We expose only the required methods publicly outside the class. This process is called abstraction.
