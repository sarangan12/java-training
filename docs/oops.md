## What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm which is based on objects. The object consists of data and the methods that operate on the data. Some of the properties of object oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. Example of Object Oriented Programming: Java, C++, Ruby

## What are some other methods of Programming Paradigms?

    1. Imperative Programming
    2. Procedural Programming
    3. Functional Programming
    4. Declarative Programming
    5. Logic Programming
    6. Symbolic Programming

## What are the advantages of Object Oriented Programming?
Programs are modular i.e. data & methods associated with data are put together which reduces the complexity ane streamlines the data access. Also, it is extensible & reusable i.e. you can extend the functionality of the classes through inheritance.
